This repository contains code for analyzing data from three Physics experiments. 
This can be built upon or used as an example of how to use Python's scipy library to perform curve fits on data.
For each experiment, a linear fit is performed on the data to find the value of a real physical variable. Chi squared reduced and goodness of fit values are also found to quantify how well the data matches the fit.
Plots of the data are also created using Python's matplotlib library.
